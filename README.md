What does this project do?

This project scrapes civil court cases in specific counties in Oregon and looks for any Tort cases, it posts any cases it finds in a Slack Channel.

This is a very specific project for Jefferson Public Radio in Southern Oregon, but it can be easily modified to work for other types of searches.
